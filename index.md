I created these games to play with my family, and I thought other people might enjoy playing them too.  I explain
how to run the games in the README.md file.  I wanted to keep the games relatively simple.  They are written so that the user's browser
can communicate with the server, but I have not figured out if it is possible for the server (Google Sheets in this case) can communicate
with the clients.

I am happy for feedback and suggestions to improve these games.  These games gave me an excuse to learn some now programming techniques.
Hopefully they are useful coding examples (whether good or bad).
